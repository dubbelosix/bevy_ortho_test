## About This Project

This project is an exploration of rendering techniques using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). It focuses on the following:

- **Render to Texture**: Experimenting with rendering scenes into textures for post-processing effects or UI integration.
- **Testing Asset Integration**: Using pre-made 3D models to test the rendering pipeline.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!
